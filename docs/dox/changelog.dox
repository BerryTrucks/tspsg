\section cl_b170 TSPSG v0.1.4 beta 2 (build 170)

\subsection cl_b170_w WHAT'S NEW

  - Support for embedded base64 encoded images when saving solution as
    HTML (\ticket{4,Ticket #4}).
  - The ability to setup page-related options for printing (\ticket{5,Ticket #5}).
  - Solution graph size can now be controlled using \c Output/GraphWidth
    setting in \em tspsg.ini. Value is in centimeters. (\ticket{8,Ticket #8})


\subsection cl_b170_c CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS

  - Any value that is entered into task table and doesn't contain
    numbers is considered an infinity.
  - Some error messages are more verbose.
  - Removed a prompt about turning off language autodetection when
    selecting a language.
  - Handheld version includes larger icons (48x48 instead of 32x32).
  - If after running Save As dialog file name doesn't have an extension
    .tspt will be automatically appended.
  - Translucency effect is available on all desktop platforms. No check
    for its support by window system is made at this moment. Blur is
    only available in Windows Vista or higher.


\subsection cl_b170_b BUGFIXES

  - \ticket{2,Bug #2}: Solution graph is too small on high resolution screens.
  - \ticket{3,Bug #3}: Solution graph font size should be fixed.
  - \ticket{6,Bug #6}: Bug: Actions in Options Menu.
  - \ticket{7,Bug #7}: No Cancel option in Unsaved Changes dialog under Symbian.
  - \ticket{9,Bug #9}: Solution graph is still exported to HTML when graph
    generation is disabled.
  - Language name was not loaded in its menu item's status tip which
    caused status tip to be "Set application language to ".
  - Icons in toolbar configuration dialog didn't follow style and one
    of them wasn't shown.

\section cl_b145 TSPSG v0.1.3 beta 1 (build 145)

\subsection cl_b145_w WHAT'S NEW

  - Solution graph generation.
  - Support for switching between available Qt styles.
  - Toolbar customization support (only on desktop platforms).
  - An option to remember last used directory when saving and opening.
  - Automatically check for updates at the given interval option (only
    on Windows platform at this moment).


\subsection cl_b145_i IMPROVEMENTS

  - Improved the solution output generation algorithm. It is now about
    1.65 times faster.
  - Dragging and dropping task file on the main window now opens it.
  - The deafult output font is now DejaVu LGC Sans Mono and it comes
    "embedded" in the executable.
  - The current desktop icon theme in Linux is now used if it follows
    freedesktop.org icon theme and icon naming spesifications.
  - Translations are now "embedded" in the executable but may be
    overrided by placing files with the same names in l10n folder.
  - Support for Windows 7 Taskbar Extensions (namely, Progress Bars).


\subsection cl_b145_c CHANGES

  - About dialog was "tabified". Added GPL License and Credits tabs.
  - Platform dependent settings (e.g. paths) are saved per-platform.
  - 32x32 icons are used on handheld platforms. This slightly decreases
    the size of handheld versions. Desktop icons are still 128x128.
  - \b Windows binary builds were moved from \b MSVC to \b Mingw-w64: no more
    <em>Visual C++ Runtime</em> dependency.


\subsection cl_b145_b BUGFIXES

  - Solution related actions not disabled when solution is canceled.
  - "Autosize" setting was never saved and was always on.

    while clicking Save button in the Settings Dialog.
  - An ability to generate fractional random numbers.
  - An ability to set the fractional accuracy (in decimail places).
  - An ability to select between using native and Qt's file dialogs
    when opening and saving tasks and solutions.
  - An ability to disable showing of the solution steps' matrices in
    solution output.
  - An ability to enable scroll to the end of the solution output after
    solving.
  - An ability ot enable automatic resize of columns and rows to their
    contents on its change.
  - Basic support for Symbian.
