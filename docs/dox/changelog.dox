\section cl_b145 TSPSG v0.1.3 beta 1 (build 145)

\subsection cl_b145_w WHAT'S NEW

  - Solution graph generation.
  - Support for switching between available Qt styles.
  - Toolbar customization support (only on desktop platforms).
  - An option to remember last used directory when saving and opening.
  - Automatically check for updates at the given interval option (only
    on Windows platform at this moment).


\subsection cl_b145_i IMPROVEMENTS

  - Improved the solution output generation algorithm. It is now about
    1.65 times faster.
  - Dragging and dropping task file on the main window now opens it.
  - The deafult output font is now DejaVu LGC Sans Mono and it comes
    "embedded" in the executable.
  - The current desktop icon theme in Linux is now used if it follows
    freedesktop.org icon theme and icon naming spesifications.
  - Translations are now "embedded" in the executable but may be
    overrided by placing files with the same names in l10n folder.
  - Support for Windows 7 Taskbar Extensions (namely, Progress Bars).


\subsection cl_b145_c CHANGES

  - About dialog was "tabified". Added GPL License and Credits tabs.
  - Platform dependent settings (e.g. paths) are saved per-platform.
  - 32x32 icons are used on handheld platforms. This slightly decreases
    the size of handheld versions. Desktop icons are still 128x128.
  - \b Windows binary builds were moved from \b MSVC to \b Mingw-w64: no more
    <em>Visual C++ Runtime</em> dependency.


\subsection cl_b145_b BUGFIXES

  - Solution related actions not disabled when solution is canceled.
  - "Autosize" setting was never saved and was always on.

\section cl_b100 TSPSG v0.1.2 alpha 2 (build 100)

\subsection cl_b100_w WHAT'S NEW

  - New \b TSPSG icon.
  - Symmetric mode: in this mode the cost of travel from city 1 to
    city 2 and vice versa is the same.
  - Printing of solution results (if the platform supports it).
  - Saving solution to PDF (if the platform supports printing).
  - An ability to reset all settings to their defaults: hold Shift
    while clicking Save button in the Settings Dialog.
  - An ability to generate fractional random numbers.
  - An ability to set the fractional accuracy (in decimail places).
  - An ability to select between using native and Qt's file dialogs
    when opening and saving tasks and solutions.
  - An ability to disable showing of the solution steps' matrices in
    solution output.
  - An ability to enable scroll to the end of the solution output after
    solving.
  - An ability ot enable automatic resize of columns and rows to their
    contents on its change.
  - Basic support for Symbian.
  - Check for updates functionality (only in Windows version at this
    moment).


\subsection cl_b100_i IMPROVEMENTS

  - Improved the solution algorithm.
  - The maximum number of cities in task was increased to 50.
  - List of alternate candidates for branching is now displayed.
  - Warning about possible non-optimal result.
  - Open a file, passed as command-line argument.
  - Currently opened file name is displayed in the Main Window title.
  - "Save Solution" and "Back to Task" buttons in Solution tab for
    better usability.
  - The size of the toolbar buttons is now determined based on the
    device DPI in Windows Mobile and Symbian.
  - SIP show/hide handling in Windows Mobile.
  - Toolbar state and position are now saved and restored with the Main
    Window state and position.
  - Window translucency support in Windows Vista and Windows 7.

\note Showing the solution steps' matrices is disabled by default
for tasks with more than 15 cities to considerably speed up the
generation of the solution output process.


\subsection cl_b100_c CHANGES

  - The resulting path is now sorted, always starts from City 1 and has
    "City 1 -> City n -> ... -> City 1" format.
  - Translations were moved from i18n to l10n folder to follow common
    standards.
  - Reworked the Settings Dialog layout.
  - Reworked the About dialog.


\subsection cl_b100_b BUGFIXES

  - A solution couldn't be found for some tasks while the task had at
    least one solution (mostly, tasks with a lot of restrictions).
  - An error when loading .zkt file with less than 5 cities.
  - Generated random numbers were not in the range defined by Minimum
    and Maximum settings.

This is initial \b TSPSG release.

\subsection cl_b42_f FEATURES

  - Solving taks with up to 5 cities.
