\section i_s1 REQUIREMENTS

To be able compile \b TSPSG you need to have <em>Qt libraries</em>\anchor cr1<sup>\ref r1 "[1]"</sup>. The minimum
supported version of \em Qt is <b>4.4.0</b>. The recommended version is <b>4.5.x</b>
or higher.

\note Please, note that there will be some regressions in functionality
if your version of \em Qt is lower than the recommended.

<hr><hr>

\section i_s2 ASSUMPTIONS

This guide assumes that you already have <em>Qt libraries</em> and all necessary
prerequisites installed.

Also, the following assumptions are made:

  - For \b Linux/UNIX: \c lrelease and \c qmake are avilable in \c $PATH.
  - For \b Windows (\em minGW) and \b Symbian: you have installed <em>Qt SDK</em> or
    prebuilt libraries and have Start Menu items for Qt tools.
  - For \b Windows (<em>Visual Studio</em>) and <b>Windows Mobile</b>: the <em>Qt libraries</em>
    reside in <tt>C:\\Qt\\</tt>.
  - For <b>Windows Mobile</b>: <em>Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK</em> or later is
    installed.

<hr><hr>

\section i_s3 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

\b TSPSG is oficially supported and tested on the following platforms:

  - <b>Linux</b>: <em>Gentoo AMD64</em> and <em>Kubuntu 9.10 64-bit AMD</em>.
  - <b>Windows</b>: <em>Windows XP 32-bit</em> and <em>Windows 7 64-bit</em>.
  - <b>Windows Mobile</b>: <em>Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional Edition</em>.

\section i_s4 BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

\subsection i_s41 GENERAL INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

On most platforms the general building and installation procedure is:

  -# Run \c lrelease to generate binary translation files (.qm) from the
     source (.ts).
  -# Run \c qmake with \c CONFIG+=release parameter to generate makefiles.
  -# Run make utility (e.g., \c make, \c nmake, \c mingw32-make) to build \b TSPSG.
  -# Run make utility with \c install parameter.

\note It is important to run \c lrelease before \c qmake, or \c qmake will not
"pick up" the translations when generating installation rules.

\subsection i_s42 LINUX/UNIX

Open a shell, navigate to the directory where you have \b TSPSG source
downloaded and type

\verbatim
tar xvjf tspsg-<VERSION>-src.tar.bz2
cd tspsg-<VERSION>-src
\endverbatim

where \<VERSION> is the version of \b TSPSG you downloaded. Now run

\verbatim
lrelease tspsg.pro
qmake tspsg.pro
make
\endverbatim

In some cases you may need to type

\verbatim
qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
\endverbatim

If make step finished without errors you can install \b TSPSG by running

\verbatim
sudo make install
\endverbatim

or

\verbatim
su
make install
\endverbatim

depending on your distribution.

By default, executable will go to \c /usr/bin, \c COPYING.txt and \c README.txt will go
to \c /usr/share/TSPSG, translations will go \c /usr/share/TSPSG/l10n, all docs
will go to <tt>/usr/share/doc/TSPSG-\<VERSION></tt>.

\subsection i_s43 WINDOWS

\note Please, read the section \ref i_s7 after reading this section.

\subsubsection i_s431 USING MINGW

Unpack the downloaded source code of \b TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the <em>Qt Command Prompt</em> from the Start
Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source and run

\verbatim
lrelease tspsg.pro
qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
mingw32-make
\endverbatim

\note Make process may fail with a crash of \c windres.exe. If you've run
into this issue, please, read the section \ref i_s61.

If make step finished without errors you can install \b TSPSG by running

\verbatim
mingw32-make install
\endverbatim

\b TSPSG will be installed to \c \%PROGRAMFILES\%\\TSPSG folder (usually, it is
<tt>C:\\Program Files\\TSPSG</tt>).


\subsubsection i_s432 USING VISUAL STUDIO

Unpack the downloaded source code of \b TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the <em>Visual Studio Command Prompt</em> from
the Start Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source
and run

\verbatim
C:\Qt\bin\lrelease tspsg.pro
C:\Qt\bin\qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
nmake
\endverbatim

If make step finished without errors you can install \b TSPSG by running

\verbatim
nmake install
\endverbatim

\b TSPSG will be installed to \c \%PROGRAMFILES\%\\TSPSG folder (usually, it is
<tt>C:\\Program Files\\TSPSG</tt>).

<hr>

\subsection i_s44 WINDOWS CE/MOBILE

Unpack the downloaded source code of \b TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the <em>Visual Studio Command Prompt</em> from
the Start Menu and run

\verbatim
set PATH=C:\Qt\bin;\%PATH\%
setcepaths wincewm50pocket-msvc2008
\endverbatim

Now navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source and run

\verbatim
lrelease tspsg.pro
qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
nmake
\endverbatim

There is no automated installation process for Windows Mobile build. To
install \b TSPSG on your PDA you need to create a folder on your device
and copy the following files to it:

  - \b tspsg.exe from \c release folder in the source directory.
  - \b QtCore4.dll and \c QtGui4.dll from \c C:\\Qt\\bin folder.
  - \b msvcr90.dll from <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\VC\\ce\\dll\\armv4i</tt> folder.
  - all <b>*.qm</b> files from \c l10n folder in the source directory to \c l10n subfolder.

<hr>

\section i_s45 SYMBIAN

Unpack the downloaded source code of \b TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the <em>Qt for Symbian Command Prompt</em> from
the Start Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source
and run

\verbatim
lrelease tspsg.pro
qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
make release-gcce
\endverbatim

\warning You need to unpack the source to the <em>same drive</em> as <em>Symbian SDK</em>
and the path <em>must not contain any spaces</em> or \b TSPSG won't build.

If make step finished without errors you can generate sis installation
file by running

\verbatim
make sis
\endverbatim

You'll get \c tspsg.sis file in the source directory. Copy it to your
phone and run or install it using <em>Nokia PC Suite</em>.

\note You need to install <em>Qt libraries</em> on your device before installing
\b TSPSG. Usually, it should be enough to install \c qt_installer.sis from
the Qt installation directory.

Alternatively, if you have installed <em>Nokia Smart Installer</em>\anchor cr2<sup>\ref r2 "[2]"</sup> you can run

\verbatim
make installer_sis
\endverbatim

You'll get an \c tspsg_installer.sis that will automatically download and
install the required <em>Qt libraries</em> on \b TSPSG installation.

\note Please, be aware that you have to sign the sis file to be able to
install it on your device. You can use <em>Open Signed Online</em>\anchor cr3<sup>\ref r3 "[3]"</sup> to quickly
sign the sis file for your device. Alternatively, you can try to enable
the installation of self-signed files in the phone settings. Please,
reffer to your phone manual on the instructions how to do this.

\subsection i_s46 OTHER PLATFORMS, SUPPORTED BY QT

While \b TSPSG is oficially supported only on \b Linux, \b Windows and <b>Windows
Mobile</b> it should be possible to compile it on any platform, supported
by \em Qt. To do so, please, refer to the section \ref i_s41 for the general build
and installation procedure.

<hr><hr>

\section i_s5 UNINSTALLATION

Usually, it is enough to replace \c install parameter with \c uninstall
in the installation command from the section \ref i_s4. Alternatively, you can manually
delete all installed \b TSPSG files and directories.

<hr><hr>

\section i_s6 TROUBLESHOOTING

\subsection i_s61 WINDRES.EXE CRASH

When building under \b Windows using <em>minGW</em> toolchain make process may fail
with \c windres.exe crash (access violation). This is a known bug in
\c windres.exe regarding processing resource files with \c UTF-8 (\c cp65001)
encoding\anchor cr4<sup>\ref r4 "[4]"</sup>. To be able to successfully build \b TSPSG you will need to
download and replace \c windres.exe with a fixed version. To do this:

  -# Open https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/ in your
     favourite browser.
  -# Find and download the latest version of <em>GNU Binutils</em>. At the time
     of writing this guide it was \c binutils-2.20.1-2-mingw32-bin.tar.gz.
  -# Unpack the file \c bin\windres.exe from the downloaded archive to
     <tt>\<Your Qt installation path>\\mingw\\bin\\</tt> replacing the existing one.
  -# Now run
\verbatim
mingw32-make distclean
\endverbatim
     in the \b TSPSG directory and repeat the installation process.

<hr><hr>

\section i_s7 NOTES

\c qmake doesn't always enclose installation paths in quotes. This may
cause some files not to be installed or removed when their path
contains spaces. In this case it is safe to delete these files and \b TSPSG
installation directory manually.
