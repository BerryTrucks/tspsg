1. REQUIREMENTS
===============

To be able compile TSPSG you need to have Qt libraries. The minimum
supported version of Qt is 4.4.0. The recommended version is 4.5.x
or higher.



2. ASSUMPTIONS
==============

This guide assumes that you already have Qt libraries and all necessary
prerequisites installed.

Also, the following assumptions are made:

  - For Linux/UNIX: lrelease and qmake are avilable in $PATH.

  - For Windows (minGW) and Symbian: you have installed Qt SDK or
    prebuilt libraries and have Start Menu items for Qt tools.

  - For Windows (Visual Studio) and Windows Mobile: the Qt libraries
    reside in C:\Qt\.

  - For Windows Mobile: Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK or later is
    installed.



3. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
======================

TSPSG is oficially supported and tested on the following platforms:

  - Linux: Gentoo AMD64 and Kubuntu 9.10 64-bit AMD.

  - Windows: Windows XP 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit.

  - Windows Mobile: Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional Edition.



4. BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
============================

4.1 GENERAL PROCEDURE

On most platforms the general building and installation procedure is:

  1. Run lrelease to generate binary translation files (.qm) from the
     source (.ts).

  2. Run qmake with CONFIG+=release parameter to generate makefiles.

  3. Run make utility (e.g., make, nmake, mingw32-make) to build TSPSG.

  4. Run make utility with 'install' parameter (without quotes).

NOTE: It is important to run lrelease before qmake, or qmake will not
"pick up" the translations when generating installation rules.


4.2. LINUX/UNIX
---------------

Open a shell, navigate to the directory where you have TSPSG source
downloaded and type

    tar xvjf tspsg-<VERSION>-src.tar.bz2
    cd tspsg-<VERSION>-src

where <VERSION> is the version of TSPSG you downloaded. Now run

    lrelease tspsg.pro
    qmake tspsg.pro
    make

In some cases you may need to type

    qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release


If make step finished without errors you can install TSPSG by running

    sudo make install

or

    su
    make install

depending on your distribution.

By default, executable will go to /usr/bin, COPYING and README will go
to /usr/share/TSPSG, translations will go /usr/share/TSPSG/l10n, docs
will go to /usr/share/doc/TSPSG-<VERSION>.


4.3. WINDOWS
------------

NOTE: Please, read the Section 7 after reading this Section.

4.3.1. USING MINGW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpack the downloaded source code of TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the Qt Command Prompt from the Start
Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source and run

    lrelease tspsg.pro
    qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
    mingw32-make

NOTE: Make process may fail with a crash of windres.exe. If you've run
into this issue, please, read the Section 6.1.

If make step finished without errors you can install TSPSG by running

    mingw32-make install

TSPSG will be installed to %PROGRAMFILES%\TSPSG folder (usually, it is
C:\Program Files\TSPSG).


4.3.2. USING VISUAL STUDIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpack the downloaded source code of TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the Visual Studio Command Prompt from
the Start Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source
and run

    C:\Qt\bin\lrelease tspsg.pro
    C:\Qt\bin\qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
	nmake

If make step finished without errors you can install TSPSG by running

    nmake install

TSPSG will be installed to %PROGRAMFILES%\TSPSG folder (usually, it is
C:\Program Files\TSPSG).


4.4. WINDOWS CE/MOBILE
----------------------

Unpack the downloaded source code of TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the Visual Studio Command Prompt from
the Start Menu and run

    set PATH=C:\Qt\bin;%PATH%
    setcepaths wincewm50pocket-msvc2008

Now navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source and run

    lrelease tspsg.pro
    qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
	nmake

There is no automated installation process for Windows Mobile build. To
install TSPSG on your PDA you need to create a folder on your device
and copy the following files to it:

  - tspsg.exe from release folder in the source directory.

  - QtCore4.dll and QtGui4.dll from C:\Qt\bin folder.

  - msvcr90.dll from
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\ce\dll\armv4i folder.

  - all *.qm files from l10n folder in the source directory to l10n
    subfolder.


4.5. SYMBIAN
------------

Unpack the downloaded source code of TSPSG with your favourite
compression software. Now launch the Qt for Symbian Command Prompt from
the Start Menu, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the source
and run

    lrelease tspsg.pro
    qmake tspsg.pro CONFIG+=release
    make release-gcce

NOTE: You need to unpack the source on the same drive as Qt and Symbian
development tools.

If make step finished without errors you can generate sis installation
file by running

    make sis

You'll get tspsg.sis file in the source directory. Copy it to your
phone and run or install using Nokia PC Suite.

NOTE: You need to install Qt libraries on your device before installing
TSPSG. Usually, it should be enough to install qt_installer.sis from
the Qt installation directory.

Alternatively, if you have installed Nokia Smart Installer you can run

    make installer_sis

You'll get an tspsg_installer.sis that will automatically download and
install the required Qt libraries on TSPSG installation.

NOTE: Please, be aware that you have to sign the sis file to be able to
install it on your device. You can use Open Signed Online[2] to quickly
sign the sis file for your device. Alternatively, you can try to enable
the installation of self-signed files in the phone settings. Please,
reffer to your phone manual on the instructions how to do this.


4.6. OTHER PLATFORMS, SUPPORTED BY QT
-------------------------------------

While TSPSG is oficially supported only on Linux, Windows and Windows
Mobile it should be possible to compile it on any platform, supported
by Qt. To do so, please, refer to the Section 4.1 for the general build
and installation procedure.



5. UNINSTALLATION
=================

Usually, it is enough to replace 'install' parameter with 'uninstall'
in the installation command from the Section 4. Also, you can manually
delete all installed TSPSG files and directories.



6. TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

6.1. WINDRES.EXE CRASH
----------------------

When building under Windows using minGW toolchain make process may fail
with windres.exe crash (access violation). This is a known bug in
windres.exe regarding processing resource files with UTF-8 (cp65001)
encoding [1]. To be able to successfully build TSPSG you will need to
download and replace windres.exe with a fixed version. To do this:

  1. Open https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/ in your
     favourite browser.

  2. Find and download the latest version of GNU Binutils. At the time
     of writing this guide it was binutils-2.20.1-2-mingw32-bin.tar.gz.

  3. Unpack the file bin\windres.exe from the downloaded archive to
     <Your Qt installation path>\mingw\bin\ replacing the existing one.

  4. Now run

         mingw32-make distclean

     in the TSPSG directory and repeat the installation process.



7. NOTES
========

qmake doesn't always enclose installation paths in quotes. This may
cause some files not to be installed or removed when their path
contains quotes. In this case it is safe to delete this files and TSPSG
installation directory manually.
