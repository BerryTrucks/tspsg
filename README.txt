 TSPSG: TSP Solver and Generator

Copyright (C) 2007-2010 LÑ‘ppa <contacts[at]oleksii[dot]name>

TSPSG is intended to generate and solve Travelling Salesman Problem
(TSP) tasks. It uses Branch and Bound method for solving. Its input is
a number of cities and a matrix of city-to-city travel costs. The
matrix can be populated with random values in a given range (which is
useful for generating tasks). The result is an optimal route, its
price, step-by-step matrices of solving and a solving graph. The task
can be saved in an internal binary format and opened later. The result
can be printed or saved as PDF, HTML, or ODF.

TSPSG may be useful for teachers to generate test tasks or just for
regular users to solve TSPs. Also, it may be used as an example of
using Branch and Bound method to solve a particular task.
